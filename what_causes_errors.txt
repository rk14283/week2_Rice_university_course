A) Name error:
1) Misspelled variable name 
2) Misspelled function name 
3) Missing import statement 
4) Not used double quotes when calling the function


B) Attribute error:  
Misspelled a constant or a call to a function in a module (the part after the period). For example, misspelling a constant or a call to a function in random or math will cause an AttributeError.


C) Type error:
1) If a function expects two arguments and is only given one
2) If integers are expected and we use strings 



D) Syntax error:  
1) One example was missing colon in function 
2) Second example was using wrong operator "=" instead of "=="

Examples question:
Which of the following results in a SyntaxError?
 print x = y
 print 5 + /2
 
 
 E) Code style and readbility 
 
 1) 
 """doc string is below a function header, 
it allows the string to over over multiple lines 
 it must have input output and how they relate
 a documentation string tells you what it does 
 but not how it does it"""
 
 2) 
 #So often to tell what a function does we use a comment 
 
 3) Use appropriate name for varibales, i.e. they must be descriptive, for example use side1, side2, side3 instead of a,b,c
 
 4) Use spaces for readability 
 
 5) You can break up the code for readability 
 
 An example of a readable code 
 def area_triangle_sss(side1,side1,side3):
    """Returns the area of a triangle given the lenghts
    of its three sides
    """
    #Heron's formula 
    semi_perim = (side1+side2+side3)/2.0
    return math.sqrt(semi_perim * 
                    (semi_perim-a) *
                    (semi_perim-b) *
                     (semi_perim-c))

F) Finally he said make sure each of your ifs have an else case
